# Introduction to research 2:
In the realm of quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, the concepts of bound and unbound states form the cornerstone of understanding particle behavior in potential fields. These states play a pivotal role in describing how particles, such as electrons in atoms or nucleons in a nucleus, interact with the forces that govern their motion and stability.
